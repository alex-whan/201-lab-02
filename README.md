# Code Fellows Code 201

## Lab 2 - Landing Page

This page is home to my Lab 2 of my Code Fellows "Code 201" course.

This project has just begun, and will be added to over time. For now, it 
is functioning as an "About Me" biography, with an associated quiz to help users get to know me and my quirks. Conveniently, it also allows me to practice writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and integrating all three languages into a functioning, interactive web page.

Please feel free to refresh the page as many times as you'd like in order to take the quiz. Eventually I'd like to implement some sort of "Click Here to Start Quiz" button and print user answers on the screen as they go.
